<Prelude label="Why types vs interfaces?">
  <M>
    As a <B>TypeScript developer</B>, it's good to use all the possibilities and
    features that this technology gives us. However, there are areas, weird
    parts, the same as in the <B>JavaScript</B> that make our learning process
    chaotic. The best example of such a subject is a good and well-known:{' '}
    <B>"Types vs interfaces"</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    To be able to use <B>TypeScript</B> features fully and with pride, today

<Section>
  <XL>Differences in syntax, use cases and mindset</XL>
  <M>
    In <B>TypeScript</B> we can create <B>type definitions</B> (contracts for
    our code) in following ways:
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Object definition via type"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/01-defs-via-types.ts"

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Object definition via interface"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/02-defs-via-interfaces.ts"
    linesCount={3}
  />
  <M>
    However, the <B>interface</B> keyword is reserved only for <B>objects</B>{' '}
    creation, but with <B>type</B> we can create definitions for everything.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Interface may be used only for describe objects"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/03-interfaces-only-for-objects.ts"
    linesCount={17}
  />
  <M>
    In the example above, we created definitions for <B>array</B> and{' '}
    <B>function</B> - there are objects too. This is how <B>JavaScript</B> works
    and it's obvious that <B>TypeScript</B> follows the same rules. Now let's
    check the <B>types</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Types may be used for describe everything"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/04-types-for-everything.ts"

</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>Mapped types don't work with interfaces</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Mapped types</B> allows you to create new types by transforming the
    properties of an existing type based on a mapping function. They are often
    used to perform operations on the keys and/or values of an object type to
    create a new type.

<Section>
  <XL>Unions don't work with interfaces</XL>
  <M>
    If you want to create a declaration of an object that is <B>A</B> or{' '}
    <B>B</B> with interfaces, it's not possible.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/14-unions-dont-work-with-interfaces.ts"

<Section>
  <XL>Differences in declarations merging</XL>
  <M>
    <B>Interfaces</B> implements something that is called{' '}
    <B>automatic declaration merging</B>. How it works? You need to define more
    than one interface with the same name and their definitions will be merged.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Implicit merge of interfaces declarations"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/07-interfaces-auto-merge.ts"
    linesCount={14}
  />
  <M>
    The same attempt done in <B>type</B> context doesn't work - they must have
    unique names per <B>scope</B>.
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Implict declarations mechanism doesn't work with type keyword"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/08-types-not.ts"
    linesCount={8}
  />
  <M>
    So, we know that <B>interfaces</B> have additional feature -{' '}
    <B>implict declarations merging</B>. In another way, declarations with{' '}
    <B>type</B> keyword must have unique names per scope.{' '}
  </M>
  <M>
    However, we can merge declarations in <B>explicit</B> way and the syntax in
    both is different.{' '}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="That's how you merge by your own with interfaces"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/09-explicit-merge-interfaces.ts"
    linesCount={13}

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="That's how you merge by your own with types"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/10-explicit-merge-in-types.ts"
    linesCount={14}
  />
  <M>
    The result will be the same object. The only difference between them in this
    context is the <B>auto-merge</B> feature in interfaces and syntax. For
    interfaces we need to use <B>extends</B> keyword but for <B>type</B> we need
    to use merge operator - <B>"&"</B>.{' '}
  </M>
  <M>
    But why did someone added auto-merge for interfaces? Imagine a library with
    badly written type definitions and you want to consume this library API.
    There is an additional function added, but someone forgot to add a type
    definition for this function or it's done in the wrong way. Thanks to this
    feature you are able to override it easily.{' '}
  </M>
  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="I want to have my own, better type defs!"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Dream-stack-for-React-dev/article/Types-vs-interfaces-in-TypeScript-fully-explained/system/en/11-lib-override.ts"
    linesCount={7}
  />
  <M>
    The other use case will be just removing the need to write the{' '}
    <B>extends</B> keyword all the time. It's the next, fancy feature. We have a
    lot of them in <B>JS</B>. Instead of typing we just need to know how
    something works.
  </M>
  <M>
    The real-world example will be a situation in which <B>library</B> doesn't
    have any type definitions. In the example below, we're adding full typing
    for <B>gatsby-plugin-dark-mode</B> library.

  <XL>Cosmetic differences</XL>
  <M>
    Look at the following code sample to understand the amount of code that we
    need to write for both.

  <Code
    mode="dynamic"
    lang="tsx"
    description="Type is just shorter..."

    linesCount={6}
  />
  <M>
    Type-based declarations are just easier to write :P, that's why a lot of
    current <B>eslint</B> rules detect such cases as above and warn you to
    rewrite it to <B>type</B> syntax.

  <XL>Impact on build/compile time</XL>
  <M>
    Under this{' '}
    <A outside href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance">

    </A>{' '}
    you have official recommendations on when to use types and when to use
    interfaces. The authors of this document provide arguments connected with
    performance.

  <M>
    By saying <B>performance</B> I mean:{' '}
  </M>
  <L>
    <Li>how long build process take,</Li>
    <Li>how fast your real-time plugins work in IDE,</Li>
    <Li>how long the compilation process take.</Li>
  </L>
  <M>
    The <B>TypeScript</B> is not providing any additional code when complied
    with <B>JavaScript</B>.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    In old versions of <B>TS</B> there was a small impact with <B>enum</B>, but
    in modern TS you can avoid this impact.
  </Hint>
  <M>
    I will verify this impact by changing interfaces to types in my big
    repository in which I have almost 500 interfaces. Later, I'll measure the
    build/compilation and developer experience in real time (I'm working with VS
    code).{' '}

  <M>
    I repeated these tests many times. In every attempt I cleaned the build
    folders and cache. In the context of numbers, there was always a difference,
    higher or lower, but the conclusion is - the version with <B>interfaces</B>{' '}
    instead of <B>types</B> had always faster <B>builds</B> and{' '}
    <B>compilation</B> times.
  </M>
  <M>
    I tried also real-time development in these branches. There were some
    situations in which when I accessed a file the first time I got a small lag
    or a longer response from the local <B>TypeScript</B> check server. So,
    looks like there is an impact too.{' '}

<Summary label="Should you use types or interfaces?">
  <M>
    We spotted a lot of differences between declaring definitions with{' '}
    <B>types</B> and <B>interfaces</B>. Some additional features are available
    in both of them, but the most important aspect is still the question from
    the beginning: <B>"Should I use type or interfaces?"</B>{' '}
  </M>
  <M>
    I think the answer is really simple to this question. If <B>TypeScript</B>{' '}
    creators recommend using <B>interfaces</B> for defining <B>objects</B>, we
    should trust them. In addition, we performed some checks so we know how big
    the impact is on large projects. It may be several seconds on each build!
  </M>
  <M>
    So, the real answer is:{' '}
    <B>
      "Use interfaces first for defining objects until you need a feature from
      type-based definitions"
    </B>{' '}
    - of course if you care about development experience and compile/build
    performance.{' '}
