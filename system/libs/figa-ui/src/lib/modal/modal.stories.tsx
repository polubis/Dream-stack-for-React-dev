        now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
        ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
        versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
        on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from?
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
        Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
        1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
        reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
        translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many
        variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised
        words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use
        a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the now use Lorem Ipsum
