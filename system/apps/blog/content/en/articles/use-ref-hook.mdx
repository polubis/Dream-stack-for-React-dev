#### Prelude

We grouped our tests into functionalities, and now we need to understand how
to divide tests by the context that they verify.

#### What are the types of tests?

Taking into account the area we are testing, the test can be divided into
the following types:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2e tests

**Unit tests** are fast and precise. They are focused on a specific thing
and answer concrete questions.

In the context of a pizza creation it will be the following situations:

```ts
describe('Pizza meets standards when', () => {
  // Take a meter and measure this.
  it('size is between 30-40 cm', () => {});

  // It's easy to check.
  it('cake is brown', () => {});

  // This is visible.
  it('cheese is melted', () => {});

  // You can touch cake.
  it('cake is warm', () => {});

  // This is visible.
  it('plate is clean', () => {});
});
```

**Integration tests** verifies cooperation. They are also quite fast. When we
write them, we don't focus on specific things as in unit tests but on checking
that "something" has been used as intended.

Instead of checking if the pizza size, color, and other, we can check if it
was made according to the recipe in the book. Below is an example of such
tests:

```ts
describe('Pizza meets standards when', () => {
  // We assume that the recipe contains the necessary steps.
  it('recipe is used from page 31', () => {});

  // Instead of verifying the size of the pizza and other
  // necessary things, we assume that the cook
  // already "knows" this and he will check it.
  it('the person making the pizza is supervised by the cook', () => {});
});
```

**E2e tests** focus on the user's perspective, not the implementation.
They are technologically agnostic and usually execute for a long time (they
operate on the finished application, not code fragments).

Instead of checking what's going on in the kitchen, how the pizza is made
and based on what recipe - we simply ask the customer what he thinks about
the taste (the customer is our application).

```ts
describe('Pizza meets standards when', () => {
  it('customer enjoys the taste', () => {});
});
```

#### Summary

As you might have noticed, mainly the context changes. We started with a
single employee (code file), we moved to a communication perspective
(several code files), and at the very end we left the implementation behind
and simply asked the customer (application) what he thinks about our
product.

That's the difference between the different types of tests. Don't worry, it
will get into your blood in the next lessons.
