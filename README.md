## Structure of repository

We have two main parts in this repo. First is an API in **.NET** ecosystem and second is monorepo in **JavaScript**. 

We used monorepo because it gives us easy way to give permissions for devs in easy way and it provides linear git history of changes in whole system. 

## Description of repository elements

Currently we have several applications:

1. First is a blog platform currently available at [GreenOn Software](https://greenonsoftware.com). We migrating it to **Next** from **Gatsby**.

2. Second is an app for musicans [jamjam](https://jamjambeings.com) - we are migrating it from **CRA** to **Next**.

3. Third is **design-system** implementation with reusable not domain specific UI. Its called **figa-ui**.

4. We have also other reusable parts like **figa-hooks** which implements reusable not app specific hooks. 

## I have idea for app

That's great. We can implement it together faster by using currently prepared codebase. 

Describe it on a dedicated channel in **Discord**.

## I have suggestions

That's great. If it's related to codebase just prepare PR with showcase and describe it. 

You can also describe it on **Discord**
.

## I see a bug in app or other ugly crap

Raise an issue and add images or gifs - we'll cover it. 

## Do I need to write tests? 

Yes üëç. We want to have scalable and easy to spot problems codebase so we need tests. 

If you have problems or there is a help required just ask for help on **Discord** or in **PR**.
