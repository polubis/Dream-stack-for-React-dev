# Contribution guide 

This document contains core information for future contributors. 

## How to be a contributor? 

Ask for being a contributor in our **Discord** channel - [Invite link](https://discord.gg/PxXQayT3x3).

We'll add you do repository and project board with tickets as soon as we can.

## The workflow

We're using the **git flow**. The **main** branch is **production**, and **develop** is **development** branch - you should always create your branches only from **development**.

## I'm added toto contributors, what's next? 

1. Pick a ticket without assignment. Assign it to yourself and change status to **In progress** when you start work. 

2. Create a branch with ticket number and name it via convention - **ticket number**/**feature**-name-of-the-branch.

So example of branch: *182/feature-add-button-component*.

3. After finshing your work, raise a **pull request** to **develop** branch and move ticket status to **review**.

> There is no time limit to task. You can work on it long as you want. 
> If you have problems just ask for help on **Discord**.

For better transparency you can add small description or provide **gif** if your changes impacts visual aspects of any application.

4. Someone will perform review. After this you will have provided any additional changes that needs to be applied. 

Be patient all of us usually work or have families so it may take some time. 

5. After successful review your ticket will be merged to **develop**.

After this you are **co-author** and you can add this project to your portfolio.
